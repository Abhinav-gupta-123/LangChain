# 🦜🔗 LangChain Learning Journey by Abhinav Gupta

Hi there! 👋
Welcome to my personal **LangChain learning notebook**.

I'm **Abhinav Gupta**, a B.Tech student and AI/ML enthusiast. I’m currently diving deep into **LangChain** — a powerful framework for building applications using **large language models (LLMs)** like OpenAI's GPT.

This repository is my open learning journal where I document everything I explore — **step by step**, with real code, clean examples, and simple explanations.

---

## ✨ Why I Created This Repository

When I started learning LangChain, I noticed that many tutorials were either too theoretical or lacked clear, hands-on guidance. So, I built this repo to:

✅ Create a **beginner-friendly learning path**


✅ Share **notebooks with working code and explanations**


✅ Explore **real use-cases** as I build understanding


✅ Help other learners like me to get started easily

---

## 📁 What's Inside?

Each folder covers one major building block or feature of LangChain. Topics are added as I learn:

| Folder                   | Description                                                        |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `1_langchain_models/`    | Load and use different LLMs (OpenAI, HuggingFace, etc.)            |
| `2_LangChain_Prompts/`   | Prompt templates and formatting for LLMs                           |
| `3_structured_output/`   | Get structured output like JSON or Python dicts from LLMs          |
| `4_output_parser/`       | Parse and validate model outputs using LangChain parsers           |
| `5_chains/`              | Combine steps using LLMChain, SequentialChain, and more            |
| `6_LangChain_runnables/` | Use `Runnable` components to build modular, flexible workflows     |
| `7_Document_loader/`     | Load data from files, web, PDFs, and other sources                 |
| `8_Text_Splitters/`      | Break long text into smaller chunks for embedding and retrieval    |
| `9_vector_stores/`       | Work with vector stores like FAISS, Chroma for efficient retrieval |

> ⚠️ I’m still learning! This repo will continue to grow as I explore more advanced topics.
