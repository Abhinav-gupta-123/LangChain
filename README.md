# 🦜🔗 LangChain Learning Journey by Abhinav Gupta

Hi there! 👋
Welcome to my personal LangChain learning repository.

I'm currently on a deep dive into **LangChain** — one of the most exciting frameworks for building applications powered by **large language models (LLMs)** like GPT. This repository is my way of learning, documenting, and sharing everything I explore — **one concept at a time**, with real code and simple explanations.

---

## ✨ Why I Created This Repo

When I started learning LangChain, I realized that most resources were either too advanced or lacked practical context.

So I decided to create:

* ✅ A **clear and organized path** for learning LangChain from scratch
* ✅ **Beginner-friendly notebooks** with step-by-step explanations
* ✅ **Real use cases and tested code**, not just theory
* ✅ A place to **share my learnings publicly** as I grow

## 📁 What's Inside This Repo?

I've organized the notebooks by topics/modules. Each folder covers one key concept or functionality of LangChain:

| Folder                   | Description                                                         |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `1_langchain_models/`    | How to load and use different LLMs (OpenAI, HuggingFace, etc.).     |
| `2_LangChain_Prompts/`   | Prompt engineering techniques and prompt templates.                 |
| `3_structured_output/`   | Get structured outputs (JSON, dicts, etc.) from LLMs.               |
| `4_output_parser/`       | Parse and validate outputs using LangChain's parsers.               |
| `5_chains/`              | Chain multiple steps together: SequentialChain, LLMChain, and more. |
| `6_LangChain_runnables/` | Build modular, flexible pipelines using `Runnable` components.      |
| `7_Document_loader/`     | Load documents from files, web pages, PDFs, and more.               |
| `8_Text_Splitters/`      | Split large texts into smaller chunks for processing or embedding.  |
| `9_vector_stores/`       | Use vector databases (FAISS, Chroma, etc.) for efficient retrieval. |

> 🔄 I update this repository regularly as I continue learning!
